Pharmadex

High-quality and affordable medicines are the foundation for a country’s ability to provide effective health care and national medicines regulatory authorities (NMRAs) must effectively register and track pharmaceutical products to ensure that they are readily available and safe. However, weak medicine regulatory systems among other factors can put people at risk of using unsafe medicines and waste limited funds especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs). USAID MTaPS Program is currently supporting interested NMRAs to implement electronic pharmaceutical management information systems using Pharmadex.
What is Pharmadex? 
Pharmadex is a web-based tool that helps streamline and track medicines registration for NMRAs to ensure that they have the most updated medicines available and approved for prescribing and use. With Pharmadex, NMRAs can: 
    • Record and organize information on suppliers and products
    • Track product applications in the registration process
    • Analyze and compare suppliers and products
    • Track critical information for decision-making, such as costs, usage, and safety

Pharmadex is a Java-based application that can run on a desktop or an Android tablet/smart phone. The software is available on the MSH GitHub site: github.com/MSH/Pharmadex.

<h1>Pharmadex</h1>
National governments must effectively register and track pharmaceutical products to ensure that they are readily available and safe. When countries have weak medicine registration systems—backlogs of drug registration applications, inefficient drug testing systems, and incomplete data on suppliers and products—they can waste millions of dollars and put millions of people at risk of using unsafe and low-quality medicines.

<ul>

<li>Analyzing and comparing suppliers and products
<li>Tracking critical information for decision-making, such as costs, usage, and safety
</ul>
